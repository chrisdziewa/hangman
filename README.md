# hangman
Hangman game made in Ruby for the Odin Project online developer curriculum.

This program lets you run the Hangman game in the command line by calling 
```ruby lib/hangman.rb``` 
from the main folder. You may load your previous game or play a new game. 
The current game can be saved before each turn by typing ```save``` instead of a letter.
Each word is randomly selected from the included text file and all chosen words are between 5 and 12 
characters long. Thanks for looking at my code!
